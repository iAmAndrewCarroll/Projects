# Cybersecurity Logging and Monitoring in AWS: Strengthening Cloud Security Operations

As part of the [**ValenTek Project**](https://github.com/ValenTech401/401midterm/blob/main/README.md), I developed and implemented a comprehensive logging and monitoring solution within AWS to enhance cybersecurity defenses. This project utilized advanced cloud-native tools and methodologies to provide real-time visibility, automated threat detection, and compliance with security standards.

## High-Level Overview

### 1. Problem Identification
The existing cybersecurity framework lacked adequate visibility into cloud activities, leaving vulnerabilities in logging, monitoring, and detection processes. This posed significant risks to sensitive data, system integrity, and compliance.

### 2. Strategic Vision
The project aimed to establish a robust cybersecurity solution by:
- Implementing automated logging and monitoring to detect anomalies in real-time.
- Strengthening security configurations and compliance with cloud security standards.
- Creating scalable solutions leveraging AWS services to address evolving operational demands.

### 3. Design and Tools
- **AWS Services:**
  - **CloudWatch:** Enabled real-time system performance and security monitoring.
  - **GuardDuty:** Provided threat intelligence for proactive anomaly detection.
  - **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Configured secure access management with least-privilege principles.
  - **Lambda:** Automated workflows for alerting and response actions.
- **Security Tools:** Integrated Splunk as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution to aggregate logs and analyze patterns.
- **Networking:** Configured DNS, TLS, and VPNs for secure communication between systems.

### 4. Implementation
- Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities in existing security controls.
- Deployed automated logging pipelines using CloudWatch and GuardDuty to enhance visibility.
- Hardened servers and implemented IAM policies to restrict unauthorized access.
- Built a centralized monitoring dashboard using Splunk for real-time threat analysis and alerting.
- Delivered training to team members on using cloud-native tools and interpreting alerts.

### 5. Benefits
- **Enhanced Security:** Improved detection and response times for potential threats.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced manual monitoring efforts with automated workflows.
- **Compliance:** Strengthened alignment with industry and DoD cloud security standards.

### 6. Challenges and Solutions
- **Complexity of AWS Services:** Resolved knowledge gaps by leveraging hands-on experimentation and cloud-specific training.
- **Integration Challenges:** Worked collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure seamless connectivity between tools like Splunk and AWS services.

## Outcome
The **ValenTek Project** delivered a scalable and efficient cybersecurity solution, enhancing cloud security and operational efficiency. By utilizing tools like CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and Splunk, I created a system capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats in real-time.
